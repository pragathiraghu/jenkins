What is an Agent in Jenkins Pipeline?
An agent in Jenkins Pipeline specifies where the pipeline or specific stages of the pipeline should run. It defines the execution environment for the pipeline (e.g., a particular node, a Docker container, or any available node in the Jenkins cluster).

Why is an Agent Used?
Agents allow you to:

Distribute builds across multiple machines or environments.
Use specific environments for specific tasks (e.g., running tests in a Docker container).
Optimize resource utilization in a Jenkins cluster.
Scenarios Where Agents are Used
Scenario 1: Distributed Builds
You have multiple Jenkins nodes: one for building Java code and another for running Selenium tests. Using an agent, you can define which node runs which stage.

pipeline {
    agent any  // Any available agent will execute the pipeline
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            agent { label 'java-builder' }  // Run only on the node labeled 'java-builder'
            steps {
                sh 'mvn clean install'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            agent { label 'selenium-tester' }  // Run only on the node labeled 'selenium-tester'
            steps {
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }
    }
}

Scenario 2: Running in a Docker Container
You want to run a build process inside a Docker container that has specific dependencies.

pipeline {
    agent {
        docker {
            image 'node:14'  // Use Node.js Docker image
        }
    }
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'npm install'
                sh 'npm run build'
            }
        }
    }
}
How to Answer in an Interview?
Short and Crisp Answer: "An agent in Jenkins defines the execution environment for a pipeline or its stages. 
It allows flexibility to run tasks on specific nodes, in Docker containers, or any available machine. For example, in a CI/CD pipeline, 
I can run the build stage on a node with Maven and the test stage on a node with Selenium."
